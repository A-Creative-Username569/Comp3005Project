first:
get book name and price from:
  book name, auther, isbn, genre

get login information from user, make sure when someone signs in, it is a valid user. I think we can skip this by allowing any username or pass to enter

if it is a new user, still insert it.


when adding a book to cart, get books price and add it to an int or double. get price of book from id, add info to int/dbl

when buying a book, change the stock of a book. go through arraylist of books by id, lower stock by one.

make sure that each book is assigned to at least 20 in the original data

when book is bought, check if book is below certain stock amount, and order enough to equal 20. search stock, if below 10, add 10.
  
for owner:
  add book to books, by changing stock count of a book. search by id of book, add to stock
  
  get sales reports of a book. We need to add a new field to book called books_sold, to get the reports
  we can then filter all by genre, total, auther, ect. search by id, get sale information
